## Forest Bathing

Forest Bathing experiences take you on a journey through the forest, immersing you in the sights, sounds, smells, and textures of nature. It is underpinned by mindfulness principles encouraging: the opening of the senses to the forest atmosphere; slowing walking through the forest; inhaling the forest air; and fostering an emotional connection to the landscape. By slowing down and engaging all your senses, you can tap into the healing power of nature and access a deep sense of calm and relaxation.

> “A health promoting, nature connection practice that aims to enhance wellbeing, relieve stress, and encourage relaxation.”

Forest Bathing is informed by the scientific evidence that aspects of the forest environment – such as rich biodiversity, phytoncides, microbes in the soil, negative ions, fractal patterns in nature, a natural soundscape, and unpolluted air – can enhance health and wellbeing. Forest Bathing takes a whole person approach and recognises the intrinsic healing capacity within everyone. It seeks to restore the dynamic balance of a living system by immersive meaningful nature experiences.

In the past twenty years people’s lifestyles have significantly changed. People are now spending most of their lives indoors, on screens. They have lost their connection to the natural world. They have lost their connection to themselves. This has had a major impact not only on human health but also on planetary health. We need a new strengthened relationship with nature and a deep understanding of ourselves for a sustainable, healthy future.

One of the core aspects of a Forest Bathing Guide is having a strong connection with the natural world so you can enhance that connection for the individuals and groups you work with.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:


The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:
